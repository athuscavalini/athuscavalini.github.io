I am a graduate student in computer science at the [Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo](http://ufes.br/). I have affinity with data science, education, design and social impact business. 

More information on my academic journey can be found in my Lattes page.

Apart from all this, I love photography, meeting new people and learn new things.
